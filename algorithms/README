LaTeX uses PDF graphics if you use PDFLaTeX or EPS graphics else.
To generate PDF graphics from the SVG files you could either open it in inkscape,
save it as Cairo-PS and then use pstopdf to convert it to a pdf graphic or you can use
a much simpler and faster way:
Use svg2pdf: Get the source by executing
git clone git://people.freedesktop.org/~cworth/svg2pdf
, compile it, copy it to /usr/bin (or something similar) and the just execute 'make' in this directory.

The PDF files have been deleted from all Git revision so don't wonder if you see strange log messages.
