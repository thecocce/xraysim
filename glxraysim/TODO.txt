GLXRaySim TODO:
-Material property dialog
-Check for more things that can be encapsulated by a QPointer (auto-deletion to save memory)
-Use VBO for cube drawing
-Develop an algorithm to draw the edges only (maybe outer edges only at first);
-Develop GLSL shaders
-Make the simple sum-up result dependent on if alpha is enabled
